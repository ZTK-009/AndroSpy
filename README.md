An Android RAT that written in completely C# by me (qH0sT a.k.a Sagopa K)  

Yes, It is supporting dns connection like no-ip or duckdns or dynu etc. and it has been tested with ngrok and portmap.io; it is working with both but you can't hear live mic because of UDP port.  

Your Visual Studio must have Xamarin Developing Kit, otherwise you can't build client.  

If you have Xamarin Developing Kit;

# Compilation
## Step 1:
[!] COMPILE THE CLIENT PROJECT IN VISUAL STUDIO ONCE, THEN YOU MAKE IN BOTTOM STEPS, OTHERWIESE YOU SEE ERROR. 
--> (THIS STEP IS REQUIRED BECAUSE OF NUGET PACKETS.)  

## Step 2:
[!] Then you must put path of each .exe in Settings window of AndroSpy and copy the all files of Client project to "ProjectFolder" path in SV project (\SV\bin\Debug\resources\ProjectFolder)  

[!] Important: Select MSBuild.exe from your Visual Studio installed path, not from .NET Framework;  

      {Installed Drive of Visual Studio}\Microsoft Visual Studio\{VERSION}\{EDITION}\MSBuild\Current\Bin\MSBuild.exe;

Don't worry, there is no complicated ``Socket`` programming; all thing is simple to understand.  

-You must also UDP port open; select item in comboBox on NAT page of Modem: TCP and UDP (both) , otherwise you can't hear live microphone.    

For Keylogger your victim must toggle on Accessibility button of your trojan in Settings of Device
